# MovieBrowser
 This is a web-based data browser created for CSCI 130 (Web Development) at Fresno State
 This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavasScript, PHP, and mySQL to store, edit, delete sort, and display data about films from a Db.
 
 To view this project, you can install the contents of the repo in a folder within XAMPP->HTDOCS. 
 After starting Apache and mySQL, you can open site.php within your browser. To initialize your DB, click JSON->DB and your DB should be created.
 You can then use the buttons to edit, create, delete, and sort the movies.
